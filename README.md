# charls-image-test

Simple C++ console application that can verify the CharLS JPEG-LS codec by using input
from a directory filled with AnyMap images (.pgm, .ppm) by encoding them to JPEG-LS and back.

This test application is not part of the main CharLS repository as it uses C++17
(CharLS is fixed on C++14 until the next major release).

Note: the AnyMap images are not part of this repository. These images can be downloaded from:
<http://imagecompression.info/test_images/>
